If you have a QuickFoodHub account, you can typically review and modify your account details by logging into your profile settings. For information that is not accessible through your account settings, or if you encounter any issues, please contact us directly, and we will assist you in accessing or correcting your data.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.2. Opting Out of Communications</h3>
                    <p>If you have opted in to receive our newsletter or promotional emails, you can unsubscribe at any time by following the detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. You may also contact us directly to request removal from our mailing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of marketing communications, we may still send you non-promotional messages related to your account, transactions, or important service updates.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.3. Cookie Preferences</h3>
                    <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can choose to set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, please be aware that some parts of the Site may not function properly if you disable cookies. For more detailed information on how we use cookies and how you can manage your cookie preferences, please refer to our dedicated <a href="cookies.html" class="text-primary-red hover:underline">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.4. Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>Where applicable law provides, you may have the right to request a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This allows you to transmit your data to another service provider if you wish. Please contact us if you would like to exercise this right.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.5. Right to Erasure ("Right to Be Forgotten")</h3>
                    <p>In certain circumstances, you may have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. This right is not absolute and applies in specific situations, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when you withdraw consent. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us, and we will assess your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.6. Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                    <p>You may have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we would store your data but not use it further for processing, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or if you object to its processing. This right is also not absolute and applies in specific conditions. Please contact us if you wish to exercise this right.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.7. Right to Object to Processing</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain situations, particularly when the processing is based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If you object to processing for direct marketing, we will stop processing your data for that purpose. For other objections, we will assess whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms. Please contact us if you wish to exercise this right.</p>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-dark-text mt-6 mb-3">6.8. Withdrawing Consent</h3>
                    <p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally agreed, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. To withdraw consent, please contact us.</p>

                    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
